  Growth Factors is the dedicated value creation team for a leading European private equity firm. We partner with portfolio companies to drive operational excellence and outsized returns.

  This organization houses tools, playbooks, and infrastructure for our **AI & Technology** practice.

  ## AI & Tech Practice

  We help portfolio companies capture AI advantage across four lanes:

  ### Ship Faster
  AI-native SDLC optimization. Agents embedded in plan → code → review → test → operate. Move from quarterly releases to continuous delivery with lower change-fail rates.

  ### Sell More
  Revenue copilots, deal coaching, next-best-action suggestions. Shift selling time from admin to closing.

  ### Serve Better
  Support copilots, smart triage, suggested replies. Deflect simple queries, elevate humans to exceptions.

  ### Run Leaner
  Workflow automation, KB with AI search, bots-first handling. Compress cycle times, reduce error rates.

  ## How We Work

  Diagnosis → Roadmap → Lighthouse → Scale

  **AI Maturity Diagnosis** — Rapid assessment across Strategy, Economics, Data, Risk, Tech, and SDLC. Output: prioritized AI value roadmap.

  **Lighthouse Pilots** — 60-90 day proof points with kill-switches, feature flags, and rollback. Prove value before scaling.

  **Tailored Projects** — Opportunity matrix mapping value vs feasibility. Wave-based execution on highest-impact initiatives.
